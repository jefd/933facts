            <p data-block-key="p835">
              You are receiving this information because you are part of a group of heritage Raytheon employees who participate in a defined benefit pension plan. In January, we wrote to inform you that Raytheon Technologies has decided to
              change the current defined benefit pension formula to an approach more aligned with our peers, while still providing employees with a source of retirement income that is valuable and flexible.
            </p>
            <p data-block-key="d2jdt"><b>This change to your pension plan formula does not take effect until Jan. 1, 2023.</b></p>
            <p data-block-key="6tvdl"></p>
            <p data-block-key="dp76l">
              In January, we sent out a communication announcing the plan change and effective date. In that announcement, we indicated that we would be following up in Q2 with the cash balance formula that will be used to calculate your
              benefits beginning in January 2023. This material includes that cash balance formula. You can find a copy of the prior communication on Desktop Benefits under the My Resources tab on the home page.
            </p>
            <h3 data-block-key="favgu">What is Cash Balance?</h3>
            <p data-block-key="d408j">
              Cash balance is a type of defined benefit pension formula that provides a guaranteed pension, but is different from what you have today. Using the cash balance formula, your pension benefit will grow with two types of credits
              from Raytheon Technologies: <b>pay credits and interest credits</b>. Each month, these credits will be allocated to a cash balance account tracked by the company on your behalf. The pay credits and interest credits you will
              earn after Dec. 31, 2022, are included below.
            </p>
            <p data-block-key="5h4hc">There are several benefits of cash balance:</p>
            <ul>
              <li data-block-key="91s9o">You may have more options on how to take your benefit compared with traditional defined benefit formulas (such as the full balance at one-time or a monthly annuity).</li>
              <li data-block-key="bn2gg">Your cash balance account is portable, meaning you can take it to another employer or roll over the balance to an IRA if you leave Raytheon Technologies.</li>
              <li data-block-key="5ao5a">You can watch your benefits grow and know your balance each month.</li>
            </ul>
            <p data-block-key="40l8g">
              It’s also important to note that while cash balance is flexible and simple, if you receive the benefit as a fixed monthly annuity for your lifetime, it may not provide as much monthly income as a traditional pension plan would
              have in the same circumstances.
            </p>
            <h3 data-block-key="24gja">Pay Credits</h3>
            <p data-block-key="dfgoj">Pay credits are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li data-block-key="a6d5n">Determined each year based on the age you will be as of December 31 of that year.</li>
              <li data-block-key="eflbh">Expressed as a percentage of your total compensation (base pay plus annual incentive bonuses that are part of a bonus plan; special one-time bonus payments or awards are excluded).</li>
              <li data-block-key="d5bir">Allocated to your cash balance account at the end of each month.</li>
              <li data-block-key="7ijtr">Provided by Raytheon Technologies - they are not deducted from your pay.</li>
